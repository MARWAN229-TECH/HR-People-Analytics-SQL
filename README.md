HR & People Analytics: Attrition & Promotion Engine
An advanced SQL-based analytical framework designed to identify employee churn risks, optimize promotion pipelines, and analyze departmental income distribution.

📊 Project Overview
Employee turnover (attrition) is one of the highest hidden costs in business. This project provides a data-driven approach to workforce management by analyzing the relationship between income, job satisfaction, and employee retention.

🛠️ Key Analytical Modules
Attrition Risk Identification: A predictive CTE that flags "At-Risk" employees who have high overtime hours but low satisfaction and work-life balance scores.

Promotion Readiness Engine: Automates the identification of employees "Due for Promotion" by crossing performance ratings (>3) with tenure and job level thresholds.

Financial Benchmarking: Analyzes income distribution by experience tier (Entry to Veteran) and department to ensure pay equity.

Work-Life Impact Analysis: Evaluates the correlation between overtime rates and attrition levels across different job roles.

🧠 Technical Skills Demonstrated
Advanced Logic: Multi-step CTEs for modular and readable code.

Complex Aggregations: Using CASE WHEN within SUM and COUNT to calculate weighted attrition rates and promotion timing.

Prescriptive Analytics: Moving beyond simple reporting to provide actionable lists of employees ready for career advancement.
